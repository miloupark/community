# Avatar Community App | Learning React Native with Expo

## ðŸ“˜ About This Project

This project is being developed while following an online course to learn React Native with Expo.
The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience with mobile app development, component-based UI, and navigation using expo-router.

I plan to build my own app called Randro based on what I learn.
